# Program Description

This program includes the following key components and functionalities:

1. **Sorting Algorithm Package (sortlib)**
   - Create a package (namespace) called "sortlib" that contains various sorting algorithms, each designed to efficiently sort data in different ways.

2. **Template-Based Sorting Algorithms**
   - Implement each sorting algorithm as a separate function using templates, enabling you to sort data of different types with ease.

3. **Testing and Analysis**
   - For each sorting algorithm, evaluate their performance by testing them on randomly generated arrays of various sizes (200, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 20000, 50000 elements).

4. **Runtime Measurement**
   - Calculate and record the running time of each algorithm for different dataset sizes.


## Usage

To use this program and conduct the analysis:

1. Navigate to the "sortlib" directory to access the sorting algorithm implementations.
2. Modify the code as needed to work with your dataset or data types.
3. Use testing and profiling tools of your choice to record the running time for each sorting algorithm.
